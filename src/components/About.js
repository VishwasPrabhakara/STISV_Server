            <h2>STIS Series</h2>
            <p>
              This Conference was initiated by India when there was dwindling manpower and lack of technology development in the area of ironmaking and steelmaking. The first Conference entitled <strong>Advances in the Theory of Ironmaking and Steelmaking (ATIS)</strong> was held in 2009 at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, focussing on the theoretical aspects of iron- and steel making, as envisioned by Professor A. Ghosh, Professor Emeritus, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, India. The overwhelming success achieved by its organization, resulted in the Conference becoming a quadrennial event and was rechristened as <strong>Science and Technology of Ironmaking and Steelmaking (STIS)</strong> to include technology. The Second, Third, and Fourth STIS Conferences were organised at Jamshedpur in 2013 (by National Metallurgical Laboratory (NML)/Tata Steel), IIT Kanpur in 2017, and IIT Bombay in 2022, respectively.

            <h2>STIS-V 2025</h2>
            <p>
              The 21st century is witnessing significant development in technology and an ever-increasing growth in the manufacturing and infrastructure sectors. With this swift pace of development, there is an equivalent increase in the demand forecast for steel production all over the world. In addition, there is a huge impetus towards the iron and steelmaking processes becoming more sustainable by reducing harmful emissions and the carbon footprint. Consequently, researchers in the process metallurgy domain are continuously engaged in developing existing technologies and exploring alternatives. Keeping this view in mind, the Fifth Edition in the series of <strong>Science and Technology for Ironmaking and Steelmaking (STIS-V - 2025)</strong> Conference is being organised to showcase the advancements in the science and technology of ironmaking and steelmaking in different parts of the world.
